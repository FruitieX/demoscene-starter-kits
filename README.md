# Demoscene starter kits

This repository contains example code and other helpful materials to get you started on developing [demoscene](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene) productions. If you're a beginner who's looking for a way to get started on developing demos, look no further!

If you have little to none graphics programming experience, [Processing](processing/README.md) is the best way to get started. It's not very fast and can later be limiting factor on what you can achieve, but it has an intuitive API, good documentation, lots of examples and most importantly, you can get your first visuals on screen in 10 minutes. Also, there's very little boilerplate code you need to write â€“ instead, you can focus on developing content for your awesome first demo.

## What is demoscene?

From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene): 

> The demoscene is a computer art subculture that specializes in producing demos, which are audio-visual presentations that run in real-time on a computer. The main goal of a demo is to show off programming, artistic, and musical skills.
