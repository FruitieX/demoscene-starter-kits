# Gettings started with Processing

These kits contain basecode to get you started on programming simple demos with [Processing](http://www.processing.org) (version 2). All of the kits use Minim (bundled with Processing) for playing music. Syncinc with music is done either in code or by using [GNU Rocket](https://github.com/kusma/rocket), a tool
 made for syncinc demoscene productions.

## Available kits

 All kits include some example drawing code to get you started. Basic kits don't utilize shaders but limit to standard Processing API (see [reference](http://www.processing.org/reference/)).

 * *basic-2d*: Draw accelerated resolution-independent 2D-graphics. If you're just starting out, this is the kit you should choose.
 * *basic-2d-rocket*: Same as above, but integrates with GNU Rocket for syncing. If you start with above, you can later integrate the syncing code.
 * *basic-3d*: Draw accelerated 3D-graphics.
 * *basic-3d-rocket*: Same as above with GNU Rocket integration.

## TODO

- [ ] import basic-2d code from previous repository
- [ ] implement GNU Rocket integration in Processing
- [ ] code basic-3d -examples
- [ ] find and add more helpful links on this page
- [ ] give a quick rundown on Processing's core (how everything works)
